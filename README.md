# AutoBugTracer â€“ AI-Powered Bug Tracker & Hotfix Recommender

> Built during #KestraHackWeek with ðŸ’™ by Geetha pranay

AutoBugTracer is an AI-enhanced DevOps assistant that:
- Traces bugs to their originating commits using logs & GitHub issues
- Suggests GPT-4-powered patches
- Auto-generates hotfix PRs
- Posts daily reports to Slack

## Use Case
Save developer time and reduce MTTR by automatically:
- Linking logs â†” issues â†” commits
- Recommending fixes based on prior patterns
- Reducing context switching for OSS maintainers

## How It Works

1. **Ingests GitHub commits, issues, and logs daily**
2. **GPT-4** identifies correlations between logs and bugs
3. **Auto-suggests patches** and creates PRs if fixable
4. **Sends reports** to Slack for human review
